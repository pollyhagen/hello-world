# hello-world
my first ever repository

Hi,
since I am very unsure what to write about, I will just scribble down some thoughts that are running through my head:
- I am not too happy with the idea of publishing my whole life story on the internet.
- I don't know why we should create a webite with our personal information.
- I do not trust the internet...
